		How powerful and fast is the new 911 GT3 RS?
		<br>
		<br>
The 911 GT3 RS quickens the pulse like very little else can. You are catapulted by the 4.0-litre, high-revving, naturally aspirated 525PS engine from 0-100km/h in just 3.2 seconds. With up to 465Nm of torque available to you, you’ll barely have time to draw breath as you make extraordinarily rapid progress through the gears. Top speed is a dizzying 296km/h. Its lightweight stainless steel sports exhaust system ensures a dramatic, unfiltered sound experience up to a maximum of 9,000rpm. With 860kg of downforce at 285km/h – a speed reached on the Nürburgring’s Döttinger straight – coupled with the Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) seven-speed automatic gearbox, acceleration and grip is at levels that constantly enthral and entertain.
<br>
<br>
What’s the difference between the 911 GT3 and the 911 GT3 RS?
<br>
<br>
The 911 GT3 and 911 GT3 RS are cars that have both been developed to make every second count, but that RS suffix – standing for ‘Rennsport’ or ‘racing’ – signals the intentions of the 911 GT3 RS from the moment you see it written along its flanks. It takes a mere glance to recognise the wider body and huge rear wing – which rises even above the roofline of the car. An imposing, sporty look. Designed to push things harder and for longer when you are on the track, with 15PS more available to you, and a wealth of aerodynamic detailing, it all adds up to triple the downforce when compared to the External icon911 GT3. This is a serious track day vehicle. No compromises have been made.

So how does it really feel when driving the 911 GT3 RS in its natural habitat – the racetrack? “It’s a racecar driver’s dream come true,” says Porsche test driver Jörg Bergmeister. “All this makes it the best-handling 911 road car ever on a racetrack. It’s so much fun, especially in the high-speed corners – the performance is just amazing.”
<br>
<br>
Is the 911 GT3 RS a track car only?
<br>
<br>
Wherever you go, it goes. The street-legal 911 GT3 RS is as happy on the road as the racetrack. Alongside its phenomenal performance, overall drivability has been improved, too. The electronic damping control system actively and continuously adjusts based on current road conditions and driving style. At low speeds, this system steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction to the front for increased agility, especially through bends. At high speeds, the rear wheels are steered in the same direction as the front for optimal stability – perfect for when it comes to overtaking on the racetrack. With this kind of all-round performance, the 911 GT3 RS proves itself to be an exceptionally versatile sportscar.
